<h1>📒 Ckumika</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Ckumika</strong> is my <strong>first-ever side project</strong>, created during my coding course.
  It is a personal website that serves as my <strong>online notebook</strong>, where I collect and organise
  everything I’ve learned while studying web development.

<h2>✨ About the Project</h2>

<p>
  The goal of this project was simple:
  to build a place where I can <strong>practice</strong>, <strong>experiment</strong>, and
  <strong>remember</strong> core web development concepts.

<p>
  Inside the project, I documented and implemented:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>JavaScript concepts</li>
  <li>HTML structure and semantics</li>
  <li>CSS styling and layouts</li>
  <li>Extra exercises, notes, and small experiments from the course</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This project helped me turn theory into practice and understand how everything connects in a real website.
